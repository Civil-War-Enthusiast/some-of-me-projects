Hello! LuauLite is a bit of code that defines Luau Runtime functions not natively on Regular Lua. I call it LuauLite because it only imports runtime functions, not the rest exclusive to Roblox.
"Imported" runtime functions:

	table.find – Searches a table and returns the first index at which a given value occurs.
 	table.create – Creates an array of a given length populated with the provided value.
	math.clamp – Clamps a number between specified lower and upper bounds.
 	string.split – Splits a string into substrings based on a separator.
	typeof – Returns a string representing the type of a given value.

These are the runtime functions "imported" into Regular Lua. Feel free to use!
